Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The purpose of this program was to create an Artificial intelligence (AI) agent that could play a pirate treasure hunt game. Specifically, it was to use Deep Q learning, an epsilon greedy form of reinforcement learning to achieve its goals. It would perform random exploration, gain knowledge, then exploit its knowledge over and over until it was able to solve the game as efficiently as possible. The environment was already set up for me. I was to create a loop that would allow the AI to explore and eventually win or lose the game. It would do so numerous times based on a specified number of epochs. 
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
In my opinion, the ultimate job of a computer scientist is to bring about innovation to various fields, whether science, technology, entertainment, or more. This is a vague sentiment, which is fitting due to the broadness of the field. Ultimately, computer science helps make out lives easier. This is important because computer scientists offer new ways to improve our daily lives in both our leisure and occupations. 
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist I approach problems logically. I compartmentalize tasks and take steps to ensure my solutions are the best they can be. 
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities are ensuring that my work is secure, clean, efficient, and more. I must ensure that my work is capable of performing itâ€™s required takes and that it does not compromise the user or organization.
